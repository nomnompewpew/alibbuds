This bill helped re-define hemp and it's legitimacy as a crop and allowed access to traditional farming infrastructures like crop insurance and domestic banking. All products including CBD oils, balms, hemp flowers and other hemp derived products are Federally legal as of January 1st, 2019.
<br>
<br>Below is the definition of hemp as defined by the Agricultural Act of 1946 (which was amended by Section 10111 of the 2018 US Farm Bill)
<br>
<br>“Subtitle G—Hemp Production. SEC. 297A. DEFINITIONS.
<br>
<br>(1) The term ‘hemp’ means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, ex-tracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.”
<br><br>Section 12608 of the US Farm Bill Amends the Controlled Substances Act to exclude Hemp from the definition of Marijuana and excludes THC from hemp from the list of controlled substances. States and local law must follow Section 297B of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 which prevents preemption of the standards set forth by the Federal government. (This means State and Local Law enforcement cannot set their own standards for THC levels or trace compounds and no criminal action should be taken without independent 3rd party testing.)
